# http-mixed-origin-pinned-20261010

Local Linux single frontend core study, four nginx origin workers. Frontends run serially. Runtime candidates remain opt-in; no default promotion.

Compact results retain errors and delivered request fractions. Saturated closed-loop mixed tests complete different proportions of small and large requests, so aggregate byte throughput alone is not a matched-workload comparison. Planned-rate tests report scheduling-inclusive latency separately from send-to-completion service latency. They use one outstanding request per small connection and expose unissued plans.

Only origin-pinned and paced studies explicitly pin independent reuseport origin workers. Results do not establish a universal 1.5× nginx advantage across workloads.
